# Microscope

**Status**: Not stable

Microscope accents an `instance` of Microcosm, injecting state as
props into children.

```javascript
<Microscope instance={ app }>
  <WillGetAllStoresAsProps />
</Microscope>
```

Documentation on this add-on is not sufficient, however this is also
not a stable plugin. As stability is achieved, updates will be
announced in the changelog.
